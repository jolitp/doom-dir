* Doom Emacs config
This file is a literate configuration of my Doom Emacs config.

Here are the Emacs LISP code that config Emacs and also the explanation of every
part of the config.

In addition to that, I also document here how I use, or intend to use, such
configuration.

***** DONE 1 Getting Started
****** discord server
https://discord.com/invite/qvGgnVx

How do I connect to the Discord server?
https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/2720

***** DONE 2 Projects with Projectile, File Explorer with Treemacs & EShell
****** "hotkeys" starting with <SPC>
calling =SPC f f= is the same as =SPC .=, this opens a pane with the
location of the current file and you can navigate from there, also it show the
files on the current directory with additional information
****** working in the context of projects
******* discover project in a directory
There is a coomand: =SPC : projectile-discover-projects-in-directory=, where
you give it a directory and emacs tries to guess based on the directory
structure if it is a project or not. If Emacs can't guess right put an empty
=.projectile= file in the folder.
******* making Emacs aware of project directories at startup
Put the following elisp code on =config.el=:

(up-to-date code)
#+begin_src elisp
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/projects/" "~/work/" ("~/github" .
1)))
#+end_src

(code from video)
#+begin_src elisp
(setq
    projectile-project-search-path '("~/code/")
)
#+end_src

You can suppress the auto-discovery of projects on startup by setting
=projectile-auto-discover= to =nil=.

You can manually trigger the project discovery using =M-x
projectile-discover-projects-in-search-path=. Or restart Emacs.

******* projectile docs
https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/usage.html
******* show all projects that Emacs knows of
Pressing =SPC p p=
******* find a file in projcet
Pressing: =SPC SPC=, will show files only from the current project
******* file explorer (side bar tree view)
Type: =SPC o p=
******* using CLI apps inside emacs
Type: =SPC o e= (~not working currently~)
****** oppening the config files by using hotkeys
Pressing =SPC f p= to "find file in private configuration", or the files that
are inside the =.doom.d= directory
****** file-related commands often used
=SPC f r= for recent files (all files)

=SPC f R= for recent files (in the current project)
***** STOPPED 3 A short intro to Dired
****** showing and hiding details
Type to toggle: =(=
****** navigating
since I enabled =ranger= I can use the following keybindings:

=h= goes back up a directory

=j= and =k= go up and down

=l= goes into the selected directory or file
****** creating folders and files
Press: =SPC .= to create files (works everywhere not only in dired)

Pressing =+= on the dired buffer to create a new folder in the current viewed
folder
****** ...,
stopped at 2:27

I didn't take notes on deleting files and directory (he explained that at this
point already)
***** DONE 4 Buffers, Windows and Basic Navigation
****** switch buffers
press: =SPC b b=, or =SPC ,= to have a list of buffer names (only on curent
project, called a =workspace buffer= by Doom Emacs)

To find other buffers (outside of project, including other workspaces), press:
=SPC b B= or =SPC <=. In this buffer, pressing =SPC= will show only the hidden
buffers
****** closing / killing buffers
pressing =SPC b k=
****** showing 2 buffers at the same time
******* splitting windows
by pressing =C-w v= / =SPC w v= to split window vertically (putting 2 buffers
side by side), or =C-w s= / =SPC w s= to split the window horizontally (putting
2 buffers on top of each other)
******* switching windows
To switch between them, =C-w w= / =SPC w w= will cycle between the windows in
order. You can also use the =h=, =j=, =k=, =l= keys to move between windows.
******* change buffer
in the second window press: =SPC b b= to change the buffer of the window
******* closing windows
to delete a window: =C-w d= / =SPC w d= or =C-w q= / =SPC w q= will delete the
active window
******* resizing windows
By pressing:

=C-w <= / =SPC w <= to grow or shrink the current window to the left

=C-w >= / =SPC w >= to grow or shrink the current window to the right

=C-w += / =SPC w += to grow or shrink the current window to the top

=C-w -= / =SPC w -= to grow or shrink the current window to the bottom

***** DONE 5 Installing Packages with org-super-agenda as an example
****** installing packages (example org-super-agenda)
on the packages file put:

#+begin_src elisp
(package! org-super-agenda)
#+end_src

after that on the command line call:

#+begin_src bash
doom refresh
#+end_src

then agree to install the new package:

: proceed? (y or n) y

****** configuring packages (example org-super-agenda)
now go to the =config.el= to config the new package

#+begin_src elisp
(def-package! org-super-agenda
;; ... config goes here
)
#+end_src

to know what can you configure in a package press:

=SPC h f= for describe function, then type =def-package=

since =def-package= is a wraper around =use-package= it is intresting to know
about it first:

github page: https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package
****** use package summary
use package has "sections" (or named parameters on the form of
=:parameter-name=)

the most important ones are:

=:init= that is everything that happens before the package loads

=:config= is everything that happens after the package loads
****** configuring org super agenda

#+begin_src elisp
(def-package! org-super-agenda
   :init ;; everything that should happen before the package loads
   (setq org-super-agenda-groups
         '(
           (:name "today"
                  :time-grid t
                  :scheduled today)
           (:name "due today"
                  :deadline today)
           (:name "important"
                  :priority "A")
           (:name "overdue"
                  :deadline past)
           (:name "due soon"
                  :deadline future)
           (:name "Big Outcomes"
                  :tag "bo")
           )
    )
   :config ;; enable the mode for example
   (org-super-agenda-mode)
   :after ;; this mode should only load after a certain mode
   (org-agenda)
)
#+end_src
****** config packages that are part of Doom Emacs
Packages that comes with Doom Emacs or packages that are part of the modules
enabled in the =init.el= file, there is another macro:

#+begin_src elisp
(after!

)
#+end_src

it is similar to =def-package!= macro, but only allows to specify certain
configuration options after another package has loaded
***** DONE 6 Quick, horizontal movements with evil-snipe
****** basics of evil-snipe
=evil-snipe= is a package that allows us to quickly jump to a character, it is
an improved functionallity that vim provides, it works in the following way:

press =f= in the =normal mode=, followed by a letter by which you want to jump
to (only in the current line!). After that the available letter locations are
highlighted and you can jump to the next one py pressing =;=, or back by
pressing =,=. By pressing any one of those the occurences of the selected letter
will also be highlighted in on the previous and next lines.

there is also =t= that will jump one character before the matching letter
****** improvements over the functionality present in Vim
as explained in the last section, when moving through the occurencies of
letters, you can go beyond the currend line. That is an improvement made by this
package.

By pressing =s= you can enter 2 letters, resulting in more precise movements

If you want to find a letter before the cursor press =F=. =S= works the same way as =F= but with 2 characters

By pressing =,= in =normal mode= you get your last search forwards, and =;= your
last search backwards;
****** selecting text with evil-snip
In =visual mode= pressing =f=, =F=, =s=, =S=, =,= or =;=
****** disabled functionallity in doom
in Doom Emacs this functionallity is disabled
#+begin_quote
 - you can ~repeat searches with =f=, =F=, =t=, =T= (ala Clever-F)~
#+end_quote

***** DONE 7 Moving around the screen with Avy
****** basics of avy
by pressing =g s= in normal mode or visual mode, the text that will be used in
the search changes color to a dark gray, then you can type the letters that you
want to search in rapid succession

if there are more than one occurency of the word/letter, the places where those
words/letters are found changes to letters that are easy to reach, starting on
the home row, like =a=, =s=, =d=, =f=, etc.
****** using avy on one window vs on all windows
there is a variable that can be customized to change the behavior of avy when it
comes to search only in the current window or in all open windows

=avy-all-windows=, can be either =t= or =nil=, for true or false.
****** changing words with avy
By pressing =g s SPC=, type a letter, or word in rapid succession, then press
=x= (to cut it), then the home-row characters presented. It will remove the
matching word (it won't put you in edit mode)
****** integration with ispell
Using the same process as above, but instead of typing =x=, type =i=

A new window will show up, where correction suggestions follows
single-characters between parenthesis. Pressing any of those letters will change
the highlighted word on the buffer.
****** moving/copying words from one part of the text to another
Press =g i SPC= then the letter/word to search, now press =y= (for
yanking/pasting), following the highlighted selection "mnemonics"

to move a word, do the same as above, instead of =y=, use =t= (for teleporting)
***** WATCHED 8 Multiple cursor in Emacs with evil-multiedit
***** DONE 9 Org Mode, Basic Outlines
not a single thing I didn't know
***** DONE 10 Org Mode - Links, Hyperlinks and more
****** links
links in org files are marked by [ [/link/location] [description\] ] (without
the spaces)

to add a link to an org file:

- link to a section of this file:
  + [[configs TODOs]]

you can highlight a section of the text and type =SPC m l l= and choose a type
of link, a name for the link and a description (if there is no highlight)

ex:

[ [file:LICENSE] [license] ] = [[file:LICENSE][license]]

normally file links are relative

[ [file:[[TODOs][README.org::TODOs] [license] ] = [[TODOs][README.org::TODOs]]

file:README.org::TODOs

if the heading does not exist it asks if you want to create one

to target a specific line:

file:README.org::44

by default numbers after the :: in the end refers to line numbers, and words
refer to headlines
****** run elisp code when clicking on a link
the link can link to a =elisp= expression.
***** WATCHED 11 Org Mode - Custom Link Types
***** STOPPED 12 Org Mode - Linking to words & Bookmarks
***** DONE 13 Org Mode, Code Snippets 101
****** opening a code section in another buffer
press =SPC m '=

: looks like it does not work on my computer, because I have the keyboard locale set to en-us international with ghost keys, when I click on ='= key it prints =´=, then I need to press SPC to actually insert the key

***** DONE 22 Deft Mode
****** enable deft
in the =doom.dir= directory, on =init.el= enable =deft= on the =ui= section
****** to setup deft
on =config.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq
      deft-directory "~/Dropbox/org" ; starting point for searching for notes
      deft-extensions '("org" "txt") ; file extensions to match on search
      deft-recurive t ; to force deft to search on subdirectories
)
#+end_src
****** using deft
to go to the deft UI, press: =SPC d=

now, just by typing I can select a specific note
******* other options
by pressing =C-c= on the deft UI you are presented with more options on a
minibuffer at the bottom of the screen. Some options are: refresh contents of
the folder, create a new file, etc..
***** DONE 23 Journaling with org-journal
****** init.el
enable journaling in org mode from =init.el= > languages:
#+begin_src elisp
(doom!
;; ...
  :lang
  ;; ...
  (org      ;; add parenthesis if needed
   ;; ...
   +journal ;; add this line
  )
)
#+end_src
****** using
pressing =SPC n j j= to add a new note, and =SPC n j J= to add a scheduled note

by default it creates a =journal= directory in the =org= directory. The filne
name is wihout any extension.

if there is already a note for the current day, emacs adds a new heading for the
current time inside today's file
****** improving jounaling notes
******* looking up on the documentation
press =SPC h v= to describe variable, then type =org-journal= to filter the
list.
******* changing the date format
#+begin_src elisp
(setq
      org-journal-date-prefix "#+TITLE: "
      org-journal-date-prefix "* "
      org-journal-date-format "%a, %Y-%m-%d" ;; Sun, 2020-12-31
      org-journal-file-format "%Y-%m-%d.org"
)
#+end_src

***** DONE 24 Org Roam Setup
****** setup
******* init.el
enable module in init.el. Remember to run =doom sync= afterwards!
#+begin_src elisp
(doom!
;; ...
  :lang
  ;; ...
  (org      ;; add parenthesis if needed
   ;; ...
   +roam ;; add this line
  )
)
#+end_src

******* config.el
add the location of the folder that org roam will use:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq
      org-roam-directory "~/Dropbox/org/roam"
)
#+end_src

a good idea is to put a =.projectile= file in that directory so Emacs interprets
that as a project directory. Also check if this directory is inside a directory
that projectile looks up at startup
****** adding notes
pressing =SPC n r c= to capture a new note
****** including links
press =SPC n r i= to insert. That will give you a list of all notes Org Roam
knows of. It can create new notes if the file specified does not exists yet.
****** see the backlinks of a note
a backlink is a link that comes to the open note from other notes.
***** DONE 25 Aliases in Org Roam Emacs Doom
an alias is another name for the same thing, like =javascript= is the same as
=js=

there is a meta property (org mode property, #+property_name:) called
#+roam_alias: "javascritp" "js"

by default the note names are taken from the titles and then from the roam_alias
property, and there is a variable called =org-roam-title-sources= that controls
this behavior
***** NO 26 Getting Started with Emacs & Doom in 2021 (on Apple Silicon M1)

possibilities of configuration, together with some examples.
******* example, extend the menu from SPC
******** ex 1: export the current org file to html

*** TODO add documentation to this config about every key mapping in Emacs and Doom Emacs
making the distinction of the keybinding comming from Emacs or Doom Emacs,
including which package overrides that keybinding, also document if the
keybinding is changed by me
* Config files

*** introduction
This file controls *what Doom modules are enabled* and *what order they load in*.
*Remember to run =doom sync= after modifying it!*

NOTE Press =SPC h d h= (or =C-h d h= for non-vim users) to access Doom's
documentation. There you'll find a "Module Index" link where you'll find a
comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what flags they support.

NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press =K= (or =C-c
c k= for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on flags as well
(those symbols that start with a plus).

Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
directory (for easy access to its source code).

  for Emacs. It also provides a Spacemacs-inspired keybinding scheme and a
  smartparens config. Use it as a reference for your own modules.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./init.el

**** Additional functions/macros
Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:

- =load!= for loading external *.el files relative to this one

- =use-package!= for configuring packages

- =after!= for running code after a package has loaded

- =add-load-path!= for adding directories to the =load-path=, relative to this
  file. Emacs searches the =load-path= when you load packages with =require= or
  =use-package=.

- =map!= for binding new keys

To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over the
highlighted symbol at press =K= (non-evil users must press =C-c c k=). This will
open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.

You can also try =gd= (or =C-c c d=) to jump to their definition and see how
they are implemented.
*** Looks
**** Fonts

Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom.

Here are the three important ones:

+ `doom-font'
+ `doom-variable-pitch-font'
+ `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
  presentations or streaming.

They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd font
string. You generally only need these two:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./config.el
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Source Code Pro"
                           :size 32
                           :weight 'semi-light)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans"
                                          :size 32))
#+end_src

**** Theme

There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
`load-theme' function. This is the default:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./config.el
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)
#+end_src

**** Line Numbers

This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./config.el
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

*** Fixes
**** Remove exit confirmation message
Removes annoying exit confirmation message

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./config.el
(setq confirm-kill-emacs nil)
#+end_src
*** Org
**** org files location

If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./config.el
(setq org-directory "~/Dropbox/org/")
#+end_src

**** roam
adds the location of the org-roam folder

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./config.el
(setq org-roam-directory "~/Dropbox/org/roam")
(setq org-roam-dailies-directory "~/Dropbox/org/roam/daily")
#+end_src
*** Keybindings
** packages.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el

#+end_src
*** Example usage
**** _
To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and *run =doom sync=
on the command line*, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
use =M-x doom/reload=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el

;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
;;; $DOOMDIR/packages.el
#+end_src

**** packages from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror

To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(package! some-package)
#+end_src

**** package from git

To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
`:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

**** package without PACKAGENAME.el, or in subdirecotry of the repo

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
`:files' in the `:recipe':

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+end_src

**** disable a package included with Doom

If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
with the `:disable' property:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src

**** overriding the recipe of a built in package

You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

**** package from a particular branch or tag

Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src

**** specify a particular commit
Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")
#+end_src

**** unpin (Doom) packages
***** single package

Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(unpin! pinned-package)
#+end_src

***** single package

...or multiple packages

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
#+end_src

***** all packages

...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;(unpin! t)
#+end_src

*** benchmark startup time

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./packages.el
;;(package! benchmark-init)
#+end_src

* Notes about configuring Doom Emacs
** _
You can configure Doom by tweaking the files found in your =DOOMDIR=. Doom
expects this directory to be found in one of:

=~/.config/doom= (respects =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME)= or =~/.doom.d= This directory is
referred to as your =DOOMDIR=. Only one of these directories should exist (Doom
will only recognize one).

Change the =DOOMDIR= environment variable to change where Doom looks for this
directory. Symlinks will work as well.

When you ran =doom install=, it deployed a simple Doom configuration to your
=DOOMDIR=, comprised of these three files:
** init.el
Where you’ll find your =doom!= block, which controls what Doom modules are
enabled and in what order they will be loaded.

This file is evaluated early when Emacs is starting up; before any other module
has loaded. You generally shouldn’t add code to this file unless you’re
targeting Doom’s CLI or something that needs to be configured very early in the
startup process.
** config.el
Here is where 99.99% of your private configuration should go. Anything in here
is evaluated after all other modules have loaded, when starting up Emacs.
** packages.el
Package management is done from this file; where you’ll declare what packages to
install and where from.
*** Note:
do not use =M-x customize= or the customize API in general. Doom is designed to
be configured programmatically from your config.el, which can conflict with
Customize’s way of modifying variables.

If you’re concerned about =defcustom= setters, Doom has a =setq!= macro that
will trigger them.
** the doom binary CLI utility
This utility is your new best friend. It won’t spot you a beer, but it’ll
shoulder much of the work associated with managing and maintaining your Doom
Emacs configuration, and then some. Not least of which is installation of and
updating Doom and your installed packages.

It exposes a variety of commands. =bin/doom= help will list them all, but here
is a summary of the most important ones:

- =doom sync=: This synchronizes your config with Doom Emacs. It ensures that
  needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are removed and necessary
  metadata correctly generated. Run this whenever you modify your =doom!= block
  or =packages.el= file. You’ll need =doom sync -u= if you override the recipe
  of package installed by another module.

- =doom upgrade=: Updates Doom Emacs (if available) and all its packages.

- =doom env=: (Re)generates an “envvar file”, which is a snapshot of your shell
  environment that Doom loads at startup. If your app launcher or OS launches
  Emacs in the wrong environment you will need this. **This is required for GUI
  Emacs users on MacOS.**

- =doom doctor=: If Doom misbehaves, the doc will diagnose common issues with
  your installation, system and environment.

- =doom purge=: Over time, the repositories for Doom’s plugins will accumulate.
  Run this command from time to time to delete old, orphaned packages, and with
  the =-g= switch to compact existing package repos.

Use =doom help= to see an overview of the available commands that =doom=
provides, and =doom help COMMAND= to display documentation for a particular
=COMMAND=.

I recommend you add =~/.emacs.d/bin= to your =PATH= so you can call =doom=
directly and from anywhere. Accomplish this by adding this to your .bashrc or
.zshrc file: ~export PATH=”$HOME/.emacs.d/bin:$PATH”~
